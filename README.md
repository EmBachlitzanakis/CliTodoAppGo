# CLI Todo List with Priority Suggestion using LangChain and Ollama 2

This is a command-line interface (CLI) Todo List application that not only helps you manage your tasks but also uses AI to suggest the priority level of each task. The app uses [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and the [Ollama 2 model](https://ollama.com/) to suggest priority levels (high, medium, low) for each task based on the provided task description.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Task Prioritization**: Get suggested priority levels for your tasks using LangChain and Ollama 2.
